##🛡️ Project README (Safe & Legal)
##⚠️ FOR EDUCATIONAL & RESEARCH PURPOSES ONLY

This repository contains code intended exclusively for cybersecurity research, secure communication studies, and understanding remote administration protocols in controlled environments.

##📘 Overview

This project demonstrates concepts related to:

Encrypted communication channels

Client-server interaction

Secure data transmission

Remote command execution frameworks

How defensive tools detect and analyze potentially harmful behavior

The goal is to help students and security researchers better understand:

How encrypted protocols work

How threat actors design communication loops

How to analyze, detect, and defend against similar patterns

This project is not a fully featured tool and must not be used outside of safe, isolated testing environments.

##🧪 Intended Use

This code may be used for:

Academic study

Learning about encryption models

Malware analysis training

Detection engineering practice

Cybersecurity defense research

Controlled lab exercises

It must never be deployed on real systems without explicit permission.
